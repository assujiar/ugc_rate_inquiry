/*
 * This script is a placeholder to guide developers on how to seed the database.
 * The recommended way to apply migrations and seed data is via the Supabase CLI:
 *
 *   supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/001_init.sql
 *   supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/002_seed.sql
 *
 * or using the supabase dashboard to run the SQL manually. Running arbitrary SQL
 * via the client at runtime is not recommended for production.
