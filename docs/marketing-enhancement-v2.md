# Marketing Enhancement v2

> **Context:** The original marketing enhancement documentation was not available. This file defines the second iteration of marketing features based on common analytics and attribution requirements. These enhancements introduce deeper insights into marketing channels, offline events, and campaign effectiveness.

## Goals

1. **Unified Marketing Dashboard:** Consolidate metrics across multiple channels (offline events, SEO/SEM, digital channels, content marketing) into a single interface.
2. **Attribution Modeling:** Provide first‑touch, last‑touch, and multi‑touch attribution metrics to measure the effectiveness of marketing channels.
3. **KPI Tracking:** Define marketing KPIs (e.g., leads generated, cost per lead, ROI) and enable users to set targets and monitor progress over time.
4. **Granular Data Collection:** Capture fine‑grained data for each campaign type to support advanced analytics and filtering.
5. **Self‑Serve Configuration:** Allow marketing users to define and update campaigns, content pieces, and offline events without developer intervention.

## Feature Overview

### Offline Events

* Create and manage event records including name, location, date, attendee counts, leads generated, and notes.
* Visualize offline event performance over time via charts and tables.
* Filter events by date range, location, and campaign.

### SEO/SEM Campaigns

* Track keyword‑level metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions, and cost.
* View conversion rates and cost per conversion across campaigns.
* Provide forms to insert and update campaigns and keyword metrics.

### Website Analytics

* Display website traffic metrics like pageviews, sessions, users, bounce rate, and average session duration.
* Compare metrics across time periods and channels.

### Digital Channels

* Aggregate performance data for social media and other digital channels (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube).
* Show conversions and cost per conversion by channel.

### Content Pieces

* Manage and categorize marketing content (blog posts, videos, infographics, emails).
* Track impressions and leads generated by each content piece.
* Link content to campaigns for attribution.

### Attribution

* Calculate first‑touch, last‑touch, and assisted conversions for each channel.
* Visualize the share of conversions by attribution model.
* Support exporting attribution reports for further analysis.

### KPI Dashboard

* Display key marketing KPIs with targets and actual values.
* Allow marketing teams to define custom KPIs and track them over time.

## Data Model

The v2 marketing module introduces several new tables in the database:

* `marketing_campaigns` – master table for campaigns.
* `offline_events` – details about offline events.
* `seo_sem_campaigns` – records for keyword campaigns with metrics.
* `website_analytics` – daily website traffic metrics.
* `digital_channels` – aggregated stats for each channel.
* `content_pieces` – marketing content metadata and performance.
* `marketing_attribution` – attribution statistics aggregated by channel and date.
* Views (`v_marketing_overview`, `v_offline_event_stats`, etc.) consolidate data for the dashboards.

## User Stories

1. **Marketing Manager:** “As a marketing manager, I want to see an overview of all my campaigns in one place so I can quickly assess performance.”
2. **Campaign Analyst:** “As a campaign analyst, I need to drill into keyword data to optimize our SEO/SEM spend.”
3. **Event Coordinator:** “As an event coordinator, I want to track attendance and leads from offline events to demonstrate ROI.”
4. **Content Strategist:** “As a content strategist, I need to understand which articles or videos are generating leads so I can prioritize future content.”
5. **Executive:** “As an executive, I want to compare marketing performance across channels and see high‑level KPIs aligned with business goals.”

## Implementation Notes

* Each sub‑module has a corresponding API route under `/app/api/marketing`. These routes query views or tables and enforce permissions.
* React components for each panel live under `components/marketing/` and use shared primitives (cards, charts, tables).
* Filter state is synchronized via query parameters and local storage to provide a consistent user experience across sessions.
* Seed scripts insert sample data for marketing v2 tables to aid development and testing.
